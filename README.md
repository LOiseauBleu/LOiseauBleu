- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in music production, UX/UI, traveling, cooking :P
- ðŸŒ± Here Iâ€™m currently learning basic programming to perhaps use these skills for my music projects (studio produsction, and live performance) on one side and for creating apps the right way. I'm currently learning Git to know how to version and collaborate, Java to get used to programming fundamentals and webdev to get a bit into the world of UX/UI.
